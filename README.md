WU Client side mods to make life easier 

These mods may need to be updated if the game itself gets an update, but they currently are working on Wurm Unlimited version 1.9.1.6

Make sure you are logged out of all Wurm Unlimited servers and Wurm Unlimited Dedicated servers before you add, subtract, or configure any mods.

1.  Download the zip file that you’ll find here.   I always download to my computer’s Downloads file, to make it easier to find things later.

This zip file contains all the client side mods that I personally am using.  I have already configured them the way I like them, so you might decide to change some that allow changes. 

There are a few other client side mods that are fine to use on Nenya server, but definitely do not use the Client Helper mod, since it is just a bot in disguise.  If in any doubt about a mod you want to add, please ask Batta before you install it.

2.  Extract the zip file to this location on your computer:
	Steam/steamapps/common/Wurm Unlimited/WurmLauncher/mods 

3.  Find the patcher batch file in Steam/steamapps/common/Wurm Unlimited/WurmLauncher  (i.e. up one level from the mods folder) and double click to run it.  It is also called patcher.bat, though not all computer systems show it that way.  Note that there are 3 different patcher files, and you want to make sure you run the batch file.

4. Each mod has a file that ends in .properties, as well as a folder containing a .jar file.  Some mods also have a .config file.

If you want to disable a mod, just rename the .properties file to .disabled.  For example, if you want to disable wurmesp.properties, just rename it to wurmesp.disabled.  

You may have noticed that I have disabled the nowinter mod.  To enable it, just change the name from nowinter.disabled to nowinter.properties.  

If you want to change the config of any mod, use the .config file if there is one; otherwise, use the .properties file.  

	Make sure to run the patcher.bat after every change.
